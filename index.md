## Welcome to the fNIRS Glossary Project


The fNIRS Glossary project is intended to develop a community-sourced glossary (i.e., useful nomenclature) of terms relating to functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) via a consensus-based methodology. We invite all fNIRS researchers to join the fNIRS Glossary Project by writing definitions, commenting on existing definitions, adding alternative definitions where applicable, and suggesting relevant references.
### Description

A common understanding of terminologies is essential at all stages of the research process to facilitate effective communication and avoid confusions and/or misconceptions. However, this is particularly challenging in rapidly expanding fields such as functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) including researchers with different backgrounds and fields of applications. Therefore, the fNIRS Glossary Project intends to develop a community-sourced glossary (i.e., useful nomenclature) of terms relating to fNIRS as a technology as well as 
- the experimental design
- pre-processing 
- data analysis of fNIRS experiments.
